summary: "The Interrogation Room Service (IRS) interfaces with the 
          Encryption Key Store Service to process Crypt4GH encrypted 
          files uploaded to the inbox of a local GHGA node. The IRS 
          splits off the file envelope, computes part checksums over 
          the encrypted file content, validates the checksum over the 
          unencrypted file content (in memory) and initiates transfer 
          of the encrypted file content to its permanent storage."
